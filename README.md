# rps-js

This project is a basic demonstration of javascript principles. It's a standard rock-paper-scissors program that accepts user input and tests it against randomized computer input. It displays wins/losses after each round, and goes on for a course of five rounds. It displays the overall outcome of winning, losing, or drawing against the computer.
